# Zen Rails Base Application

## Summary
Base or "skeleton" application for Ruby on Rails 5.1 projects. Built to 
minimize the time spent writing boilerplate code and performing repetitive 
setup tasks. 

It comes with a preselected set of tools which I believe to be the most
efficient and widely used. If you are looking for greater flexibility, an
application template which uses Rails's templating system such as [Rails
Composer](http://www.railscomposer.com/) should be a better fit as it allows
the user to choose which templating engine, test framework, JS framework and
other tools to use.

Although this project is opinionated regarding tool choices, community 
feedback and contributions are always welcome and highly appreciated.

## Features
It consists of a Rails 5.1.3 app, including:
- A selection of useful gems for development and debugging such as
[rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop),
[brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman),
[awesome_print](https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print),
[byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug), and
[better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors).
- Preconfigured test environment, including:
    - [RSpec](http://rspec.info),
    [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl),
    [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) configured to work with
    [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) and
    [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/),
    [Database Cleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner),
    and [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov).
    - General purpose test helpers, custom matchers and shared examples in
    [spec/support](https://github.com/brunofacca/zen-rails-base-app/tree/master/spec/support).
    
- Preconfigured authentication with the [Devise
gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).
- Preconfigured authorization with the [Pundit
gem](https://github.com/elabs/pundit).
- Internationalization (i18n)
  - All of the base application's strings are in YML dictionaries. This is
  arguably a good practice even for single language applications. Having an
  internationalized base application makes it easier and faster to translate
  elements like Devise, the layout and error messages when creating a single
  language app in a non-English language.
  - Methods for translating enum attributes, including the generation of
  translated options for select boxes. Implemented and documented in
  [app/models/application_record.rb](https://github.com/brunofacca/zen-rails-base-app/blob/master/app/models/application_record.rb)
- jQuery
- HTML Layouts developed with Bootstrap 3 ([bootstrap-sass
gem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)) to use as a starting point,
including:
    - Navigation bar;
    - Displaying of flash messages and validation errors as Bootstrap alerts;
    - Role-based layout switching: different layouts for guests 
    (unauthenticated users), ordinary users and admins;
- Controller concerns such as `SkipAuthorization`.
- User-friendly error messages (flash) on exceptions such as 
`ActiveRecord::DeleteRestrictionError` and `Pundit::NotAuthorizedError`.
- User management interface for admins in `/admin/users` with pagination
([kaminari gem](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari)) and searching/filtering 
([ransack
gem](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack)). Accessible only by 
users with "admin" role. 
- Seed users for the development environment.
- Contact form built with the [mail_form
gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/mail_form).
- E-mails "sent" in the development environment are saved as html files in
`tmp/letter_opener` ([letter_opener
gem](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener)).
- The following JavaScript libraries:
  - [Select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) for better select boxes.
  - [SweetAlert2](https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2) for better JS popups,
  including the replacement of the default `data-confirm` confirmation by a
  better-looking version.
  - ZenUtils: a small JavaScript library consisting of utility functions. See
  [app/assets/javascripts/zen-utils.js](https://github.com/brunofacca/zen-rails-base-app/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/zen-utils.js).  
- SCSS utility classes for alignment, spacing and font size standardization. See
[app/assets/stylesheets/utility-classes.scss](https://github.com/brunofacca/zen-rails-base-app/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/utility-classes.scss).
- High test coverage.

## Development Environment Dependencies
- Ruby 2.3+
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Required for running JavaScript-enabled feature specs:
    - [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/)
    - [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
    - [Xvfb](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) if
    running feature specs on a console-only (no graphical interface) *nix
    environment.

Consider using my [Zen Rails Development
Environment](https://github.com/brunofacca/rails-development-environment). It
 consists of a Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) Vagrant VM with all of the 
 above dependencies preinstalled.

## Usage
Setup tasks such as configuring  time zones, default locale and action mailer
(e.g., SMTP or transactional e-mail service) are not included in the following
steps as they are not specific to this base app.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your machine.
3. Rename the application: 
    1. *Required*: change the module name in `config/application.rb` 
from `ZenRailsBaseApp` to your application name, in camel case.
    2. *Optional*: Use your IDE's "search all files" feature to find and 
    replace the following strings:
        - Replace `zen_rails_base_app` by `your_app_name` 
        - Replace `ZEN_RAILS_BASE_APP` by `YOUR_APP_NAME`
        - Replace `Project Name` by the project's name
        - Replace `replace@me.com`  manually by the different e-mail addresses
        that should send and receive e-mails in various parts of the 
        application.
4. Run `bundle install` to install the gems listed in the `Gemfile` and their 
dependencies.
5. Run `yarn install` to install the front end (JavaScript) packages listed 
in `packages.json` and their dependencies.
6. Configure the databases:
 
    1. If using PostgreSQL, uncomment the `pg` gem from the `Gemfile`. If 
    using MySQL, uncomment the `mysql2` gem.

    2. Uncomment the section of `config/database.yml` corresponding to your 
    chosen DBMS.
  
7. Before attempting to run the application or its test suite, run `rails 
db:create db:migrate db:seed` within the project's root directory. That will 
create the following seed users:
    - Ordinary user: email: `user@test.com` / password: `Devpass1`
    - Admin user: email: `admin@test.com` / password: `Devpass1`
8. Customise the authentication setup. You may want to change one or more of 
the following items: 
    - Aside from Devise's default attributes,
    the `User` model also has `role`, `first_name`, and `last_name` attributes. 
    - Aside from the Devise's default modules, this app also uses
    [Confirmable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/devise/Devise/Models/Confirmable),
    [Timeoutable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/devise/Devise/Models/Timeoutable)
    and
    [Lockable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/plataformatec/devise/Devise/Models/Lockable).
    - Pundit is used for for authorization. The `User` model has an enum
    attribute called `role`. Its possible values are `:user` and `:admin`. The
    default value is `:user`.
9. Customize the application colors by overwriting Bootstrap's variables in 
`app/assets/stylesheets/global.scss`.
10. Remove unused items from the application, such as gems from the `Gemfile`, 
RSpec helpers, custom matchers and shared examples from `spec/support`. 
11. Consider going through the [Zen Rails Security
Checklist](https://github.com/brunofacca/zen-rails-security-checklist) before
deploying the application to production.

## TODO
- Install and configure the [Secure Headers
gem](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders).
- Set up CodeClimate with Rubocop, Reek, Brakeman, and ESLint engines.
- Set up continuous integration.
- Use Yarn instead of gems to install front end libraries such as jQuery and 
Select2.
- Add an asterisk to the labels of required form fields.
- Internationalize and translate the JS front end, mainly `global.js` and 
`zen-utils.js`.
